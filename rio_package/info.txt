This mini project is based on the idea presented in CS:APP by Bryant and O'Hallaron from Chapter 10.

For some background...

Read and Write functions copy at most n bytes and perform some operation on them; in the case of read, it copies theses bytes and transfers them to memory, and in the case of write, transfers those bytes from memory to the current file position that has been indicated. There are situations where these routines transfer fewer bytes than requested, known as short counts. These occur for the following reasons:

	- Encountering EOF on reads
	- Reading text lines from terminal
	- Reading and writing network sockets
