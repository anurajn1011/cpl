Initially a repository of C code written while learning C using "The C Programming Language: 2nd Edition" By Kernighan and Ritchie.
Mainly comprised of solutions to some exercises from the text, divided by chapters.

This repo has grown to now include some projects and examples from CS:APP by Bryant and O'Hallaron, which will become the main chunk of this repo going forward. 

Further notes can be found in individual directories.
